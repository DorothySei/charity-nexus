## How to Configure in Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard

3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each environment variable:
   - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID`
   - **Value**: `e08e99d213c331aa0fd00f625de06e66`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development

   - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHARITY_NEXUS_ADDRESS`
   - **Value**: `0xC339D8Fd330979E50D7e8D7Ce5f78F7D380668c7`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development

   - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK`
   - **Value**: `sepolia`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development

   - **Value**: `https://1rpc.io/sepolia`
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development

5. Save the configuration
6. Redeploy your project

## Important Notes

- All environment variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser
- Make sure to use the correct contract address for your deployment
- The WalletConnect Project ID is required for wallet connections to work
- After adding environment variables, you need to redeploy for changes to take effect

## Troubleshooting

If wallet connection still fails after configuration:

1. Check that all environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify the contract address is deployed on Sepolia testnet
3. Make sure you're connected to Sepolia network in your wallet
4. Check browser console for any error messages
